Personal project to practice vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript skills!

## Motivation

I started my journey as a (specifically web) developer with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) on my very first internship, with zero clue on what web development, HTML or CSS were.

Some time passed, and my next internship got me started with [React](https://reactjs.org/), which eventually became my main framework. Library after library after library, burdensome tasks slowly got a lot easier to achieve.

Now, on my first full-time job, I'm capable of doing relatively complex tasks with this tool, but found myself struggling to understand the very same building blocks which make it up! Having to constantly research about basic HTML and CSS features made me realize just how much I've been negatively impacted by missing out on building a solid knowledge foundation before diving into the sea of endless utilities which do everything for me. I want to finally understand the behind the scenes.

Maybe it's time to go back, for the first time, to the basics.
